## Installation

``` sh
pip install hwid
```

## Usage

### As a Module

```python
import hwid
print(hwid.get_hwid())
```

### As a CLI Tool

```sh
uvx hwid
```

## Motivation

TL;DR I don't want to copy and paste it again...

I have created a bunch of desktop applications for Windows. I needed a way to license my applications for my users to use it without distributing to other people. I decided to use the hwid of the computer to license my applications. I needed a way to get the hwid of the computer, so I created this module. It has only one purpose: getting the hwid of the computer. It is cross-platform and does not require any external dependencies.

## Features

- Cross-platform
- No external dependencies
- CLI
- Module

## Warning

I do not recommend using this module for licensing purposes all alone. You can use it as a part of your licensing system.

If you are using server-client architecture, you can send the encrypted hwid to the server and check if it is valid. But keep in mind, It's easy to intercept the http requests with [mitmproxy] or other tools.

If you are using a local licensing system, you can encrypt the hwid and store it in a file. Then you can check if the encrypted hwid is valid. You can use [pyarmor] to obfuscate your code. It will make it harder to reverse engineer your code. Here is a [NeuralNine Tutorial][neuralnine-tutorial] using [Oxyry][oxyry]

## Development

Clone the repository and cd into the project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hasansezertasan/hwid
cd hwid
```

The commands below can also be executed using the [xc task runner](https://xcfile.dev/), which combines the usage instructions with the actual commands. Simply run `xc`, it will popup an interactive menu with all available tasks.

### `checks`

Run all checks to ensure code quality:

```sh
uvx "validate-pyproject[all]" pyproject.toml
uvx typos
uvx vulture .
uvx ruff check
uvx taplo lint pyproject.toml
uvx ruff format
uvx taplo format pyproject.toml
uvx mypy
```

### `docs:serve`

Serve the documentation locally:

```sh
uvx --with-requirements requirements.docs.txt mkdocs serve
```

### `docs:build`

Build the documentation locally:

```sh
uvx --with-requirements requirements.docs.txt mkdocs build
```
